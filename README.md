##Math File Parser and Evaluator
This is parser and evaulator of mathematical expressions stored in a text file.
It has only two class **MFparser** which is used to parse and analyze the text file, and **MFfunction** which is used to evaluate the parsed expression.
###MFparser public member function:-
1. **MFparser(std::string);** :- Constructor, which takes the filename as argument filename must be of type string
2. **MFopen(std::string)** :- Opens the file, mentioned through the passed filename and deletes previous records.
3. **MFfileopensuccess()** :- Checks if the file is opened succesfully. Returns true if the file is opened successfully.
4. **void MFlexicalanalzye()**:- Parses file and create lexem.
5. **bool MFsyntaxanalysis()**:- Checks whether the file is syntactically correct or not. Returns true if the syntax is correct.
6. **bool MFsemanticanalysis()**:- Performs semantic analysis. Returns true if the file is semantically correct.
7. **bool bad()**:- Returns true if the file is syntactically or semantically incorrect or if the file is not yet analysed.
8. **void MFerror()** :- Print the errors in the file in stdout.
9. **std::vector\<std::vector\<Lexem\> \> MFgetparseroutput()**:- Returns the output of the parser. Lexem is a user defined datatype included in parser.hpp. The return value will be the input of the MFfuntion class. Returns an empty vector of vector of type Lexem if the file is incorrect.

###MFfunction public member function:-
1. **MFgetparseroutput(std::vector\<std::vector\<Lexem\> \>)**:- This function takes the output of the parser as argument as mentioned above.
2. **std::vector\<std::string\> MFundefinedvar()**:- Returns a vector of string which has the name of the variables which are undefined.
3. **long double MFevaluate(std::vector<long double>)**:- This will evaluate and return the final result. It takes a vector of long double type as argument which must have the value of the uninitialized variables in the same order in which **MFundefinedvar()** returns the name of the variables. If anything goes wrong such as if the number of uninitialized variable is 2 and someone has provided only 1 value, then this will return **NAN**.
