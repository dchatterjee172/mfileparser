# Example
Note that it will only return the value of the last variable declared in the function file, in this case which is "return". But the code can be hacked to return the value of all the variables.

### supported operators:-
1. + addition.
2. - subtraction.
3. - unary minus.
4. * multiplication.
5. / divition.
6. ^ to the power.

### supported funtions:-
1. sin(x) :- return the sin of the x. x must be in radian.
2. cos(x) :- return the cos of the x. x must be in radian.
3. exp(x) :- returns E to the power x.
4. fabs(x) :- returns the absolute value of x.
5. log(x) :- natural log of x.
6. log10(x):- log base 10 of x.
....can be added more

One can understand the rules of the function file by going through the temp.txt file. I have used a complicated mathematical expression. It has only 5 undefined variables (see the main.cpp).
